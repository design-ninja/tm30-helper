# Privacy Policy for Thai TM30 Helper

**Last updated:** December 26, 2025

## Overview

Thai TM30 Helper is a browser extension that helps users auto-fill the Thai Immigration TM30 form. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

All information you enter (guest profiles, passport details, etc.) is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's built-in storage (`chrome.storage.local`). This data never leaves your browser.

## Data Sharing

We do not:
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Share data with third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Store any data outside your browser

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **storage**: To save guest profiles locally on your device
- **activeTab**: To fill the TM30 form when you click the extension
- **Host permission (tm30.immigration.go.th)**: To interact with the official TM30 website

## Data Security

Your data is stored locally in your browser's encrypted storage. Only you have access to this data. Uninstalling the extension will remove all stored data.

### PIN Protection

The optional PIN feature provides an additional layer of security:
- PINs are stored as SHA-256 hashes, never in plain text
- Brute-force protection limits incorrect attempts
- Session timeout automatically locks access after inactivity

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
